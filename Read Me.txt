Open *index.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes/ligatures.

JDS comes with its own SVG icon system and a comprehensive library, which comprises a growing number of elegant outline icons. This component injects SVGs into the site, so that they adopt color and can be styled with CSS.. See this guide for more info: https://github.com/kiibriia/jds-ico

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.
