# ICONS INSTALLATION PROCESS

Place scalable vector icons anywhere in your content.

JDS comes with its own SVG icon system and a comprehensive library, which comprises a growing number of elegant outline icons.
This component injects SVGs into the site, so that they adopt color and can be styled with CSS.

##Icon Library Installation
Use the css file in your application HTML

    font-family: 'julyico' !important;
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: normal;
    font-variant: normal;
    text-transform: none;
}

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kiibriia/jds-ico/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
